# Weekly report 6

Time spent: 2h

### What I did

I was really busy this week and unfortunately didn't get to spend almost any time on this project.
I did play with try few React sidebars but I didn't get any to work properly yet to make the front better.

### What I learned

I learned about different react sidebars.

### What was hard

Nothing but the lack of time was :D

### What will I do next

I will try to finish the frontend next week as soon as possible. It is already good but I want to add some time comparisons to the algos etc.
I will also correct pylint next week.
