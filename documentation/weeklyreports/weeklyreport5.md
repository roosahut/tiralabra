# Weekly report 4

Time spent: 17h

### What I did

This week I spent over 10 hours trying to deploy the app to fly.io, and eventually I did success. The app used too much memory for the free tier, so I had to take it down... I was really annoyed but had to keep moving.

I also finally started doing unit testing. I also did a lot of documentation, and added Docstring to all of the import code.

### What I learned

I learned a lot about doing unit tests for algos.

### What was hard

Starting the unit testing felt really hard because I didn√§t know where to start, but i figured it out.

### What will I do next

Next week I will probably do even better unit testing. I will also add some elements to the frontend.
