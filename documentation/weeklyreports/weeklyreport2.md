# Weekly report 2

Time spent: 15h

### What I did

The first thing I did this week was read about python libraries that can help me with reading openstreetmap and the visualizing the map and the route.
I ended up using the osmnx and folium libraries, and so far for the visualization the program makes a html file of the map and the route.
For the algorithms I did a working dijkstra algo and tried doing the ida star too but I couldn't make it work yet.

### What I learned

I learned a lot about using openstreetmap abd now understand how to use it to count paths. I also learned and studied a lot about the algos, even more than before.

### What was hard

The hardest part was definitely truing to get the IDA* to work, and I still didn't succeed. I spent over 6 hours trying to fix it and I have no idea where to go with it.

### What will I do next

Next I will try to get IDA star to work and then I will try to plan the yser interface. I'm thinking about doing a web application with React but we will see.
