# Final report

Time spent: around 10 hours

### What I did

I made the panle to the frontend so you can choose which algorithm to use and also see how long the route is and how much time it took the algorithm to calculate the route.

I also wrote rest of the documents and a little bit testing. Did a lot of performance testing too.

### Final thoughts

This was a relly interesting project and I learned a lot. I'm happy with my choices even thought Fringe Search was hard, but it thought me a lot. I got mostly everything I wanted to do done, but of course there are always things I could have done better...
