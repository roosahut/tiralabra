This is a project for the Datastructures and Algorithms project course in the University of Helsinki.

The goal is to compare two shortest path algorithms, Fringe search and Dijkstra. The original plan was to compare IDA* and Dijkstra but I changed it because IDA* was not working well for the massive graph from OpenStreetMap that I'm using in this project.
